Among the competition in Razer, MSI, Asus, Lenovo, Alienware and the others in the gaming laptop market, this machine performs above the margin. It's a great choice, but remember there are always other options out there. Having to use this for work, specifically website design and video editing, it works like a charm in all areas.",

                "Cons": "Ok. I don't like the touchpad, it needs dedicated Left Click/Right Click buttons. Also; it seems like the Wireless AC like to \"power down\" over time, it works fast after resetting it but an hour later all your web browsing will crawl. That may be my router though. The battery on this is not impressive, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours out of it just web browsing. The screen is dim, you'll need to have it maxed out 90% of the time. The graphics on this thing is weird too, I can't describe it but it's like the HD4600 is \"reverse throttled\" and it's like paired with the 860M they 'work together' I think. (Not SLI just, they are aware of each other) Oh, Windows 8 is horrible- immediately install Windows 7. Despite the internet, their are drivers that easily install the 860M up to FULL SPEED (10.18.10.3960). Oh, did I mention the touchpad? : ) One more thing, you cannot use an external mouse *ON* this laptop, the matte surface doesn't work well with lasers.",
                "Pros": "I can get 75 GFLOPS out of this thing on QuikMark; without using 100% procesor power. The 860M is so awesome, Skyrim on Max 60FPS no problem. It can handle anything you throw at it. I even use it for work and it's speed has increased my productivity. Speed aside, this thing has the BEST SPEAKERS I've ever heard on a laptop. The DOLBY profile panel makes all sound jump off of your integrated OR external speakers. Super Slim and Sexy, Backlit Keyboard.",
                "Comments": "You know it's an amazing machine, all quirks aside. It's nice to play games basically at max settings. The keyboard is fine don't worry (I'm a programmer); it has decent tactile feedback. The Fn keys dont always work (touchpad on/off, airplane mode, ect). Oh, this thing will awake from sleep if you just open the lid- can't seem to fix that. I was barely affected by the lack of DVDROM, the USB drive was fine to install Win 7. SSHD gets 111Mb/sec on QuikMark, which isn't quite what I expected. Overall? BUY THIS THING! Lenovo did a great job! I <3 my Y50!",

I didn't buy this laptop off of newegg but I still want everyone to know not to buy this thing. They're thinkpads might be great but that certainly didn't carry over to the gaming line.

It seemed like the Battery was intermittent and the power cord was loose or something. It just kept rebooting without warning. I started trying to upgrade all the drivers and discovered the trouble was with the wireless driver. Once I replaced that, the Machine started working properly. I still get a blue screen occasionally on Battery, but if it's plugged in it works fine and is actually faster than some of my desk tops. So now I love it and use it a lot and take it every where. It's older so it will not connect to some newer Wifi. Most of the time Wifi works great with the latest Intel driver",

It redid the hard drive easily and is running faster again. Although I had to download about 150 Microsoft updates! That took all night. Still using Win XP. I often buy refurbished and most of the time it's a good buy. Once in a while you get a problem, but they do get tested before they go out.",

The listing claims that it comes with an 8GB SSD, but after opening the back panel, I can verify that my laptop definitely did not. When I contacted Newegg about it, they said I would have to (understandably) send in the laptop to verify that it doesn't have the 8GB drive. I need this computer, and the process would take a week. It wasn't worth it for me to send in the laptop for a drive that is worth about $20 at most.",
                "Pros": "I have had this laptop for about a week now, and it seems to be stable, fast, and has an absolutely beautiful screen. I'm coming from Windows 7, and I was dreading the change to Windows 10. I'm not super happy with it, but it is bearable. Overall, the hardware choices made in this laptop seem to work well, and it can play most games at fairly high settings.",
                "Comments": "Like I said above, this is a great laptop, but I can't give it 5 eggs because Newegg has not responded well to my concerns about an incorrect listing on their site. Even after calling their customer support, they told me to take the issue up with Dell, as their laptops supposedly have the 8GB SSD in them. I cannot see how this is true, as they come from the manufacturer without the SSD.",

Acer still no help. Purchased a USB wireless adaptor, which is working. Other con is the goofy touchpad, which has a mind of its own and drove my wife crazy when she would use it.

The speakers are absolutely terrible and have been warbled off and on, but finally after six months of owning this laptop, they suddenly just gave out for no reason and any tiny noise like a facebook notification is very loud, drawn out static. I've plugged in computer speakers, headphones, etc and the sound is the same terrible noise. I have taken great care with this laptop, but these things have still happened. The back doesn't come off, so there's no way to get inside the computer. I can't return it because the warranty was only 30 days. My experience with the laptop has been really not great and even if I could send it in to get it looked at (somehow, even though you can't psychically look inside it to repair any internal things), I wouldn't want it back again. Looks like I'm stuck with this until I can afford to buy a new laptop. Waste of $300.",

                "Pros": "I bought this notebook for school purposes. I usually run microsoft word, power point, adobe reader, internet browser, and occasionally for games. It suits my purpose because i'm able to carry this notebook with me to school and back and work on tasks on the go. The boot speed is average depending on my how much data is on the hard drive. It runs smoothly when I play music through it, and im able to run a hdmi out to a sound system to receive the best quality it can offer.",
                "Comments": "Overall if you are looking for a notebook that is going to be used for typing essays,researching, or casual browsing i would recommend it but for an extra 100$ you can get a more reliable laptop",

This is a blatant and inexcusable manufacturing defect.

                "Cons": "This laptop is far from perfect however, It's a windows 8 laptop, so the problems with OS that are still in effect here. However, the Classic Start Menu program I downloaded from the net made it much more useable. The touchpad is good, but not the most reliable. Sometimes it doesn't respond to movement unless you press hard on the pad. This happend on my old laptop too, so it may be an issue with my fingers... Anyway, the screen looks a bit \"off\" compared to normal laptops. And although it's 1080p, not all games will run well at that resolution. I'd also be lying if I said I was happy with only 3 usb ports, but I'm sure a USB hub will fix that problem. It has, for the record, only one audio jack that functions as a mic and a headphone jack. The headphone jack mode works, but each time you have to switch settings around in a menu to make sure it's on the right mode. It's annoying, especially when you are running full screen programs, plug something in, and get dumped to the desktop, but nothing I myself can't handle. Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of a disc drive, which is odd considering there's a big space for one on the side. Not sure what that's about..",
                "Pros": "I bought this laptop mainly for gaming, and I think it does the job decently. It's no alienware, but it's reasonable. MGR: Revengance, Mass Effect 2, and even Sonic Generations work pretty well after a bit of setting fiddling. On the hardware side, the backlit keyboard is useful for dark areas (as well as showing off to family members). Plus it's pretty light. The screen can bend nearly all the way back, which is impressive but also kind of scary for those who aren't used to that kind of flexibility. The sound is great with the Dolby Digital Plus software that's pre installed. And the battery life isn't half bad either.",

Over heating causing thermal throttle to kick in followed by serious lag while gaming. Dead pixels ,screen got replaced and after few weeks dead pixels started showing up again. ssd randomly disconnecting, wifi don't connect after sleep or hibernate , have to restart to connect.

As a YouTuber, I can get up to 1080p60fps doing lightweight gaming like Minecraft and Roblox (low graphics settings, but I'm sure it can handle higher)! The i7 really kicks butt and the SSD boots up the computer super fast (<5 seconds). As for Adobe, it also works excellent handling Photoshop and Illustrator at a breeze.",

Was not expecting that at all, so at the price these refurbished T430s are going for, I feel like I got a steal. Only problem is that the supplied 65W doesn't have enough juice to power the GPU, and beefier CPU so it only charges in sleep mode. Not a big deal, just going to buy a higher rated power supply. After I drop a SSD in this machine, it's going to be blazin' fast for a computer manufactured in 2012.",

The machine does have 32GB, yes, however, what the manufacturer fails to tell you is that about 12GB of that is reserved for the OS and heaven knows what else on an unchangeable partition that can only be accessed through diskpart. Even then, about 12GB of space total is open when you first get it with all the bloatware installed. Also, the thing literally runs out of space for no reason. After installing office, Netflix, and Spotify, I was completely out of space. I can't even use Windows Update because I'm out of space. Thankfully, I was able to get it up to 600MB, but that's it.",
                "Pros": "It's a cheap laptop that runs Office, Chrome, Netlfix, and Spotify. Does exactly what I need it to do right now. The keyboard feels nice and the screen isn't glossy, which helps in brighter areas. The screen is decently lit on its highest setting. Rather unexpectedly, the trackpad supports multitouch, which is nice. Battery life is decent and the standby time is good as well. I can get about 5-7 hours of battery while doing basic tasks (browsing, office, etc.) with the screen at just above half brightness and the \"balanced\" power mode. The laptop can actually play some very, very old games alright. I have RCT3 and Star Wars EaW installed to an external USB drive.",
                "Comments": "So, in review, overall the laptop does what it needs to. It runs office and can browse the web. However, due to the lack of consistency of basic features such as the trackpad and the inexplicable loss of space, I personally could not recommend this product to anyone. I know it's cheap, but the HP Envy is too, and it's much more solid than this. Personally, I don't think I will buy another PC from Acer. They have other great products (such as the monitor I bought), but this laptop has turned me off from their other PCs. I hope you found this review helpful and thanks for reading!",

I personally didn't mind that it came with Windows 7 instead of 10, because I don't like Windows 10, but it should have been stated in the product description that it was Windows 7! Concerning the OS, it arrived missing some device drivers. Even with the issues I've listed, I am still glad I bought it, and would buy again but I'd definitely get the extended warranty.",

A scratch is a scratch that typically can only been seen. A ding is an indent that has shifted or removed material. These things to some extent are acceptable. Specifically scratches. Surface scratches should be expected along the entire exterior. A few dings are acceptable. Not two dozen. Refurbished also means that the computer has been thoroughly cleaned and brought back to 100% functionality. This means the fan is moving air and not clogged with crud. Often refurb includes a new battery or one with low cycle count. Refurbished does not leave copious amounts of hair, dirt and liquid evidence inside.",

Windows 10 installed with no other bloat ware. Excellent purchase for her needs. Laptop is responsive, clean, and easy to use. They even downloaded google chrome and box media player. I know I could have just done that on my own but the fact that they thought ahead and made it just that much easier to use this product right out of the box was helpful. So far so good I will update at a later date if any issues arise.",

I tested the boot up times between my late 2013 rMBP and the Razer Blade and the Blade booted in less than 7 seconds compared to 12-15 sec rMBP.  Also shut down times was amazing averaging 4 seconds.  This thing is fast and its a real beast of machine.  So far battery life seems to last as advertised.  I haven't played games on battery yet so we'll see.",

I went ahead and took a chance and kept it, and I am definitely glad I did. Don't believe all the bad hype about the screen.  As long as you are in front of it, it's perfectly fine.  You really need to have this thing in front of you to appreciate it.  No review is going to replace the hands on experience with this notebook.  If you are interested in the Blade, then just get it.

                "Cons": "The touchpad is super sensitive, I have trouble using it, but it could just be my hands.  The power cord battery box is massive, as other reviews stated, but seriously even larger than I was expecting.  I've hidden it in a box made to sort/hide cables and it's fine.",
                "Pros": "If you are looking for a rugged laptop, this is it.  I have physical disabilities and use my laptop 12+ hours a day from my recliner.  It's always getting shoved aside or dropped or walked on by cats and dogs.  The last one literally fell apart in my hands, the hinges finally gave way and the monitor was only hooked to the keyboard by wires.  This is my second Dell, and I love their keyboard layout.  Even with disfigured hands, I can type without too many errors on the Dell layout versus other laptops.  This Dell also has a heavy case, you can tell it's built to be used and to last.  The supplier (JoySystems) is an authorized Microsoft refurbisher and has good reviews, so I felt comfortable buying refurbished. The shipping was fast, set up was easy and the updates needed loaded pretty well over the course of a day.  Had to restart once, it shut down during an update, but it worked the second time and all was good.",

So far it has been great for browsing, watching Netflix, etc. The startup time for this laptop is between 5-10 seconds so that's also a plus. The touchpad is very responsive. Battery life is as advertised. Probably 6-8 hrs or so for light browsing.",

My friend, who also has the same laptop, said he was able to run League and Csgo at 120 fps so I guess its good for some minor gaming too. Besides the heat issue I dont really have any problem with the laptop. I got it on sale too so all in all Im satisfied with the purchase.",

                "Cons": "The fan noise is very noticeable during the boot up. It's not stressing to the max but after I let the laptop sit for a little bit the noise gets minimal. However, if I start running softwares immediately after the startup then the noise that is noticeable prolongs a bit longer than I would like. Not too big of a deal for me since I ran some videos and programs and the fan still is not stressing like the startup process. I have not tried running softwares after I turn my pc on from sleep mode rather then turning it off.",
                "Pros": "It's thin, light, finger print works well and so far no technical issues. The processing speed is not bad for a laptop either. Boots up fairly quick. The graphics is good for me as well. It's not a gaming laptop but YouTube videos run great. The audio sounds great to me as well for a laptop.",

This is a little powerhouse for a little amount of money and I do not regret my decision to purchase. Hopefully it will last me my 4-5 years of college, and if any problems arise I will report back. This is a very good laptop for someone who needs something they can do schoolwork, light gaming, streaming, and some engineering programs. I give this laptop 4 Eggs as it is affordable, good bang for the buck, and easily upgradeable.",

It shipped within 2 Days, was packaged beautifully, and arrived in great shape. It is a refurb, but well worth it in my opinion. I see no dent's or scratches, which would have been acceptable if there were. It is a nice clean install of 7, so I don't have to wipe it and start over. I'm putting AVG and SpyBot on it now, as well as Chrome. It has passed all scans so far. I will do a Bios check, but I don't think I'll see anything wrong.  Great system for the price. To get an I7 at this level, WITH stand alone graphics, was something I was unable to find, and I jumped on this the second I saw it. You give up an inch in screen, but it's a rugged little case, and there are HDMI and VGA ports to plug an external monitor in if you so choose. It comes with the standard bloat ware, but I'll remove that soon enough.",

Since the screen is small, it's portable and good for school or business, but the resolution really is lacking and you feel as though you have way less desktop real estate than you really do... esp, if you are running two docs side by side, you really can't see much.

It would do this every once in a while. After the first year, about 10 keys were completely unusable. Popping the battery in and out fixes the problem temporarily. Other reviews have stated previously the same issue. Only doing the update to confirm that this is a common issue and recommending users to spend their money elsewhere.",

Off the top of my head I specifically remember, the 1 key at the top of the keyboard, as well as the u, the right arrow key, the 5 on the number pad to the right, and I believe the t. In the past, I only had to spam these buttons for a while and they'd work. Now they will not work at all no matter what I do. Other keys still work after spamming them, including the space bar, and the left arrow. Most others function normally. It's rather disappointing. While browsing online for a way to fix this, I've found that others with this exact model have had no success completely fixing it. Also, some other Acer laptops have had this issue but it seems users can fix those, so it appears to only be this exact model that cannot be fixed. I did not buy a laptop intending to use a separate keyboard and certainly not the onscreen one. I had hoped to continue to easily bring this to school or when visiting friends but now I have to bring a usb keyboard as well, which is obviously a bit of a hassle. If I had encountered this problem in time to return the laptop I would have. But it has been around 2 years that I've had it now (it started a while ago) and based on others' experiences with sending it to get repaired, only for the problem to come back immediately or shortly after, I won't be wasting the money to get it repaired anywhere. As I said it's disappointing. I shopped around for a bit before choosing this laptop, and otherwise it functions very well for the price. So if you don't mind using a separate keyboard, it's not as big a deal.",

                "Cons": "When operating heavy graphics, the screen will occasionally blank. The program will continue running, only you cant see it. the shortest It's gone blank is less than half a second, but the more the graphics, the more the blanking. 4 Seconds is the longest, but I was running War Thunder on Movie Graphics. Also, the proximity of enemy players seems to affect it. All I do is lower the graphics one notch and the problem is mostly solved. My last computer ran the smallest games at 2 FPS, so A brief screen blank does not even affect my no scoping. Maybe a Graphic Card upgrade will fix this, but I am a ways off from being able to buy a new one. I haven't tried sending it in due to other reviews on this problem. Short battery life, but I don't care. I never really spend 3 hours away from an outlet.",
                "Pros": "I got mine for $870. It is an amazing Computer as it can run large programs without overheating. the only vent is on the side and in the keyboard. I am able to stream with it easily, and the only lag I have ever had has been my internet's problem. Windows 8.1 sucks, but it was an easy upgrade to Windows 10. I put a virus on the computer, and within 10 minutes of dialing Asus' number, it was solved at no cost. The large screen is amazing and the numerous USB ports are valuable. Great computer overall, but I would recommend getting an open box one and save a hundred dollars. Also wait for it to go on sale. Sales are good.",

So far, it has served me well, with the aforementioned cons. None of the mentioned cons were huge deal-breakers, they were just just nuisances. If you travel a lot and need a lot of battery life, want a powerhouse that can run your favorite games at ultra-level graphics, then look somewhere else.

I don't really get the idea of dividing the hard drive into 2 partitions (comes pre-configured in 2 partitions, 1 partition for OS I guess and the other your stuff) but I might just merge it cuz I don't need 2 partitions.",

When they came back, 1 of the 5 would hold a charge. We shipped them back a second time. They came back and all 4 still wouldn't charge. What kind of techs does Newegg have working for them. How hard is it to power up the unit and see that it isn't charging the battery before you ship us another defective unit. We have now sent them back a third time. Here is where it gets funny. Newegg is saying they can't help us because the 30 day warranty is up. WHAT!! They never worked to start with. If you buy these, Newegg will burn you on them. I have spent hours on the phone with them and talked to supervisors and they will NOT help you. Please don't waste your money on these units.",

We have never ever had any problems with Newegg before, but after this, we will be looking for another company to spend our hard earned cash with. Shame on you Newegg. Just because you are the big buy and we are the little guys doesn't mean you can just basically steal $1,200 from us.",

In my opinion this reflects very poorly upon the standards of New Egg. They have friendly staff, and are willing to help in do far as they can. But if you want a working computer ASAP DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Be willing to have to go through hours on the phone on hold and have to send the machine back and later wait 2 weeks for a replacement which is not guaranteed to have a working battery",

I'm comfortable replacing those kinds of things when this needs it. Good luck playing 'Refurbished Roulette'.",

                "Comments": "I purchased this MacBook Air because I needed a laptop for basic school work and down time video streaming. Honestly, it\u2019s get that job done well. In comparison to a Windows machine my parents got me for Christmas years ago from around the same time of this MacBooks release, this machine caught me by surprise. Yea, the body was a little beat up, a few dings in very few places, but nothing like what I\u2019ve seen some of the reviews saying there were. Honestly, my machine, I was surprised to see cake in better condition than I was expecting for a $300 MacBook. That\u2019s where I run into a problem, it\u2019s $300. The only major issue I have is the overheating problem I\u2019ll have while doing work. I figured that had to do with age, which is to be expected, cleared out the air filter a bit, used a can of air to take out any residual dust in the fans and it improved by quite a bit. The battery life itself I managed to actually get 3.5 hours max even though I was overheating, but that\u2019s also because I stopped using Chrome as my main browser. I even notice on my Windows machine I personally built and on my room mates windows laptop that I used to test my theory, that chrome did run up the temps and usage. But that still didn\u2019t clear up the problem, just stops it from happening as much. If you\u2019re going to be video streaming, try to lower the quality settings to 480p or 720p, streaming at 1080p will cause it to overheat. Other than that, if you want a good performing machine say for your child who needs one for college without breaking an arm or leg or a sacrifice of your wallets internal organs, then this machine will be more than perfect. I may upgrade this one in a year or so, but for now, I\u2019m very content with this device and I hope to see others make this purchase too. If it wasn\u2019t for the overheating, I honestly rate it 5 eggs. Battery life I can\u2019t truly complain because most laptops are only 4 hours of life and that\u2019s even some 2018 models. So good job Apple for making a long lasting device and good job Newegg for the good refurbishing. Happy customer right here! :D",

The laptop worked like a charm until the installation of Windows 10 Creators Update which gave me a 0xc000000f bsod error. I scanned the HDD for errors, found no bad sector. Crystaldiskinfo gave it a \"BAD\" label. I i decided to use one of my hard drives in it because my customer could not afford to wait for a replacement laptop. The laptop now works like a charm!! Too bad the hard drive was faulty! One thing I found weird is that the laptop was advertised with 250gb HDD and it had a WD black 7200rpm 320gb broken HDD in it! EDIT: with the new HDD, the computer would still crash after Windows 10 1703 build. Tried with another Windows 10 key, worked like a charm! Tried again with the key provided with laptop, same BSOD. The 1703 update was rejecting the key provided with the machine. Also, I realized the Windows key sticker was already scratched and the key was fully revealed when i received it!",

                "Cons": "I don't have too many complaints about this laptop, however I will list a few things. To start with I don't like having to use dongles since they are sometimes an easy thing to lose. The next would have to be that McAfee came pre-installed on the machine, granted this is a personal preference, I removed it as it has caused me trouble in the past. After that the only other issue I had with software was that after Windows updated, the fingerprint scanner is not always responsive so I found myself typing the password in if I locked the machine, or if it went to sleep, on a fresh reboot it works every time. Noise wise I did notice a very tiny amount of hissing or what people call coil whine if I was close to the laptop when it was under a heavy load (in my case watching a movie laying on my couch). And finally my last nit-pick would be that the top being so glossy and snazzy as it is, it is a total fingerprint magnet and needs wiped down quite a bit. I don't feel it deserves to lose an egg since some of this is personal preference and different usages cases would yield different results.",
                "Pros": "Out of the box this laptop felt lightweight and well built. While being small and portable is was very fast and capable for most tasks including some light gaming. While being small and portable the screen features full HD resolution (1920x1080) and the picture is decent. Battery life was 1.5 -  8 hours in my usage cases, depending on if I was watching videos, playing a game (yes it has nVidia graphics so it can run some games), browsing the web, or working on documents. The backlit keyboard is also a welcome addition. When under load the laptop was not too noisy and didn't seem to get all too hot ( though it did get rather warm under continuous loads).  Windows 10 was not too much of a hassle to get setup and running, and the laptop itself didn't seem to be too loaded down with unwanted software or extras. The speakers also sound decent for their size. The SSD is decent speed wise (sata speeds) and just adds to how well the unit runs overall. It came with a small assortment of accessories, such as a USB to LAN dongle, an HDMI dongle, and a storage sleeve. The fingerprint scanner is nice when it works (see cons).",
                "Comments": "I used this laptop now for about 4 weeks, it has been stable and fast. It's very portable and light. And while it's not a gaming machine, it was able to play some games and handled multimedia, like Youtube, very well. It would be nice if the memory was upgradable, and I could ask for some more ports, but these are the sacrifices made to have an ultra-portable computer. I cannot fault it since it runs fast and is very stable for how much power they have packed into such a small and lightweight machine. I could easily recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a portable, yet high powered laptop, having an i7 and an SSD just make working on it nice and quick with very few if any hiccups. Lastly I will say that it can play games, and will get warm and throttle when doing so, however it's not sold as a gaming laptop, so I have no real complaints with it. It has been a joy to use during all of my testing.",

I did add an SSD drive and maxed out the RAM in mine, but I run Adobe creative cloud on it using mainly Photoshop and Premier Pro almost constantly and have for the last 7 or 8 years. I edit hundreds, sometimes thousands of files at a time. This computer keeps right up, no issues, no lag.  Am only looking to upgrade because I dropped it walking into a hotel down south. Screen is cracked now, and entire front right corner of the computer is pushed in. Surprisingly it is still working absolutely fine. This computer has made me a believer in Asus products and will be making a new Asus purchase here real soon like.",

I took it to geek squad to get the door looked at and they said that they have tried everything and it just doesn't want to close. so being as it is, it got stuck on something in my bag and got ripped off so now it pops off quite frequently. I never had a problem with it running games I have tried but I don't play huge MMORPG's or RPG's so I cant comment on that. The touch screen is nice to have but with its awkard weight and size I have never used it but to scroll when reading articles.  all in out, if you have the money and not looking for a pressure cooker that you will have no problems running stuff on this seems like a good buy.",

I am an IT professional and use this machine for things the vast majority of users would never think of. I immediately upgraded to 8GB of ram upon receiving it and so far have had no complaints. I can comfortably run a Windows 7 virtual machine and swipe back and forth between that and the Mac OS 10.9 host with no noticeable lag. If I boot into my Windows 8.1 partition I can play games with lowish settings and decent frame rates this includes rift, swtor, and world of tanks(at a little above minimum). If I play WoW, which is extremely rare these days, I can run it at medium settings with 40-50 fps. Not bad for intel integrated graphics. Honestly, it does more than I ever though was possible with an entry level(for Apple) 13\" laptop. I am typically a Windows user, and though OS X leaves something to be desired in the ways of window management, it still isn't bad. As for an average day to day user for checking email, watching youtube videos, and the occasional flash game, this will never be an issue. But, for a power user, the lack of reasonable window management can be frustrating. It is excellent for swiping back and forth between two full screen windows, but any more than that becomes cumbersome. Any time I do any web development, or extensive work with spreadsheets and databases and I feel burdened by the software. I also have a seperate Windows 8.1 partition which I use periodically for games. With the Apple bootcamp software, the trackpad and keyboard work wonderfully, take a slight hit in battery life, but otherwise, it works seamlessly. I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants excellent battery life and quality.",

Before this I used a few cheap PC laptops, and while they were never super fast they did always seem to work. I got tired of having to replace those PC laptops all the time along with the shoddy build quality so I thought a MacBook Pro would be the solution. My warranty runs out this summer and I'm honestly just too afraid of something else going wrong on this. I'll get called the PC fanboy or whatever, but I just want something reliable that works. I'm going to switch over to a ThinkPad when I can sell this - I have a co-worker who has been on a T410 for the past few years without a hitch, and a company I recently did some contract work for also had a fleet of ThinkPads all going strong. Thing is, I can get a well equipped ThinkPad for about $750 which is going to be as fast as my MacBook Pro was - sure it will be running Windows, but as an IT professional I found myself running Win 7 VM all the time since Visual Studio and SQL Server still have no Mac versions and are required for the work I do.",

Dell and HP both offer similar laptops, with the same LiPo batteries (though still not quite as long of a battery life), many similar features, and the same basic specs, but they are as expensive or more expensive than the MacBook Pro.",

Even worst, was the very large pressure mark on the LCD screen. it was visible on every screen, plus it was bad enough that it was visible even when the laptop was turned off! This pressure mark was roughly 7\"- 8\" wide and about 4\" tall in the middle of the screen. It started about 1/3 of the way down the screen from the top of the screen. Looked like someone had closed a spiral notepad in it, and then just left it there. It should never have been shipped even as a Grade \"B\" refurb (which it pretty obviously wasn't a refurbished laptop). If that wasn't bad enough, the OS that came on it apparently belonged to a Middle School, and in order to receive any updates you needed the school's password! This was completely unsatisfactory, and I immediately RMA'd it back to Newegg the same day that I received it. They are supposed to be replacing it with a different unit, but that will take an additional 7-10 \"business\" days from the time they receive it back. The sorry part in this it that their warehouse (Newegg) is only a 30 minute drive from my home.",

To put it simply, the insides of the computer are fine - the outsides are why I'm choosing to sell it to a friend who refurbs computers and purchase a different laptop. I spent too much money on this to feel like I'm using a children's toy. Honestly, the trackpad is so annoying that I literally yell out of frustration when it stops working because it happens so frequently. Furthermore, the lightweight frame and small screen would likely appeal to someone who travels a lot, and I got it with that mindset because I used to travel with my laptop often - I regret it.

I'd suffer in quiet dissatisfaction through the flimsy discount construction (you've probably gotten sturdier fast food containers) and the fact that it seems to have problems extending to other monitors at 1080p, if it wasn't for how absolutely frustrating the track pad is. The cursor likes to shift dramatically under the slightest pressure and the left/right buttons are part of the trackable area. So if you position the cursor over something, when you lower your finger onto the right-click area, it'll register it as movement before it registers it as a click-- so the cursor moves and you right-click somewhere else. Drag and drop: same problem. Scrolling? Same problem. (Two finger swipe-to-scroll works with IE, not in chrome. I guess that's a software issue and not a hardware issue, but due to the fact that I can't work around it by using trackpad \"normally\", I'm counting against the laptop itself.). The Fn key to disable the trackpad doesn't even work, so even when I plug a mouse in, the slightest motion of the trackpad while typing sends the screen into a frenzy of undesired activity.",

I fixed those issues as best I could and proceeded to carry it too and from classes for about 6 months now. Over that period of time it developed a number of issues. I began to notice screws falling out of the bottom of the PC, the keyboard dropping keystrokes fairly regularly, and the CD drive has locked up to the point where it won't open, and I'm afraid to force it. Another frustrating issue is the trackpad. Even at the beginning it wasn't great, but that was just a lack of responsiveness. Now it will occasionally stop working altogether, necessitating a reboot of the system. I've also noticed a drop in battery life. When I first got the computer I could get about 6 hrs of battery at medium screen brightness. Now it tells me I can get about 4.",

The screen is low on resolution but has good angle viewing and colors. Again for the price I think it would be hard to beat. The computer looks nice and performs as advertised. Double boxed and well packed for shipment.",

Gave the 128GB SSD addition to Manjaro and left Windows 10 behind on the stock 64GB EMMC drive where it belongs.  Dual booting for now in the unlikely event Windows 10 is needed once or twice.  Windows 10 has been needed once already to upgrade the BIOS with the latest firmware from the Acer website - a quick, easy and painless operation.  A supervisory password had to be set in the BIOS to make the option to disable secure boot available (to boot linux iso from USB).  After that, just had to change boot order to USB first to install linux iso from USB, and then to the new SSD first after linux install to boot into the GRUB boot menu (Manjaro or Windows) instead of straight to Windows 10 by default.",

Killer battery life 7-9 hours, running Linux Mint 19 on the internal 64GB MMC, Mint works great with no hardware problems, and Windows 10 on a Intel 545s M.2 2280 512GB in the M.2 slot.  Made a backup of the installed acer version of Windows 10, reinstalled the Acer version of windows 10 twice trying to get it onto the M.2 drive and it over wrote the 64GB Linux install. Downloaded the Microsoft Windows 10 media creation tool and did a clean install of Windows 10 on the M.2 512GB Intel SSD with not problems, runs better than with Acer version of windows 10.  *** The acer version of Windows 10 would not allow TRIM to run on the Intel M.2 SSD, that is the reason I used the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool for a unmolested version of Windows 10.  I purchased this for a light weight notebook with a 1080P IPS display to browse the web and document creation.  I thought the 4GB would be to much of a limitation, although its been fine with 10-15 tabs open, even does well with 4K streams on Youtube. I tested the 4K to see if the CPU could handle it, no frame skips. I love this little laptop. Mine was a refurb... and it looked perfect out of the box.",

The laptop I was replacing was a 2013 model MacBook air that I had installed windows on, on day one. (I have no cause or desire to learn Mac OS.) I liked the thin and light and small footprint. There really wasn't anything windows based to compete at that time.  I used the mac air mostly for surfing in bed, watching movies, organizing media, and to take while traveling. I have desktop PC's decked out for gaming so that is not a priority. Recently, the mac air died and I needed replacement. After some research and comparisons, I settled on this one. This thing is perfect. nearly as thin and nearly as light. Much better screen and resolution. Much faster CPU. Plenty of memory and a 1Tb PCI-E SSD. That's 1Tb! Not much in this price range with that kind of drive. Same battery life which is saying alot. Much better gaming ability. I knew going in this thing wasn't going to run Doom 2016 or Far Cry 5. There are 10 Lb laptops that whine like jet engines to do that. However, the older generation games run surprisingly well. Ie portal, Left 4 Dead, Star Craft. etc. And I mean 60 to 120 fps well. Like perfect. That is a neat and unexpected bonus (those games are fun and a real treat for a boring hotel evening while traveling.) So I give this 5 stars all day long. With such a low power CPU and no HDD at all, it is eerily silent. No heat when on ur lap. Little fan only spins up on big loads like gaming. The screen is perfect. I did not want any resolution higher than 1080p. Just doesn't make sense to me with a 15\" screen. More desirable on a 75 inch TV I think. In conclusion, very highly recommended.",

There are ways to install Linux onto the chromebook, but unless you really know what you're doing, it can be a pain in the rear for some people.  Even with linux intalled, I was unable to use java.

Its battery life is amazing, but not an ideal gaming computer.  There is 320 gb of local storage, which is more than enough with the additional 100gb of free storage in google drive.  After one day I have found \"cloud\" replacements for all the things I typically do on the computer.  I would sincerely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a secondary computer/ laptop.  The reason I say this is because of its different local storage system.  Google WILL store all of your music (up to 20,000 songs) and store unlimited amount of normal sized pictures in the cloud.  Call me kooky, but I still like having a computer with the pictures and music physically on it.  My mother uses this chromebook as a visual teaching aid (she is an art teacher), the possibilities with this thing is endless.  In conclusion, no matter your age this is a perfect notebook for you.",

The only thing missing was built is Bluetooth and a backlit display However HP includes a slick built in, a hidden keyboard light. It;s totally cool! HP installed a slick LED keyboard .Press the button near the mic and voila. Other than that this is a perfect supplement for a desktop machine. The i7 processor is quick. No lag in launching or downloading or anything. Joy systems is great and immediately responsive with email. I was worried that the battery would come depleted and dead alas, it's fully chargeable and holds that charge like new. 4.5 hours with low power settings. It's hit or miss with these refurbs. I bought one from a different vendor and it was a total bust. This one is like striking gold.",

I never had any crashes with this and I have had it about 2 weeks now and have done all the updates from Windows and Asus including updating Bios to 306 and windows to 1809. So I don't understand others having so many troubles or saying the machine is worthless without upgrading the ram.",

It is so light it is easy to move around with just one hand with an open screen. The bios protects you from outside booting so if you want to boot from a usb device you must disable protection in the bios. Also if you want to remove the 16gb optane memory it looks like you can easily change settings to ACHI also in the bios but haven't tried it yet. Bios also was updated as it was outdated.",

The only way I can use this laptop comfortably is when it is hooked up to an external monitor, and if that is the case, I should have just bought a desktop computer. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem with Asus laptops???",

While the optane card is helpful for mainly bootup times, 4GB of RAM by today's standards may not be enough.  Heavy Internet users who never close browsers could possibly experience applications getting hung up due to low memory availability.  But if 4GB turns out to be not enough, the RAM chip can be upgraded.",
                "Pros": "The ASUS Vivobook is a great laptop.  There is a lot to like.  The build quality can easily be compared to a certain rival \"fruit\" company, I won't name, who's comparable product easily cost 2 or 3 times as much.  The VivoBook has an aesthetically beautiful frame.  The shell is seamless and the top has a metallic look, touch and feel.  The build is solid.  It's not too heavy but it does have a noticeable weight and I think it's due to the battery and the additional nVidia MX150 video card built-in.  This particular model has a 15 inch screen which, in my opinion, means it crosses the line into the \"less portable\" class.  But I guarantee you, it feels portable.  Most people won't be embarrassed to carry it around and it fits very well in a small-ish backpack.  Side note, my 3 year old 15inch gaming laptop does NOT fit in the backpack... the VivoBook's very thin frame made all the difference.  With an enormous battery life, there may not be a need to carry around the power adapter.  Even though the adapter itself is takes up very little space.",
                "Comments": "Overall the ASUS VivoBook is full of features and can be great to use at home or on the go.  Even with a 15 inch screen, it's portable enough and stylish enough to carry around.  In case anyone is interested, I did try its gaming capabilities.  It is definitely not a gaming laptop, so don't plan on playing any modern AAA games with it.  Most of the modern AAA games require much more DRAM and VRAM.  However, I did try Fortnite and surprisingly it ran fairly smooth at a 1080 resolution but most of the graphics quality settings had to be turned down to medium or lower.  So I imagine less graphics intensive games and modern 2D side scrolling games will run just fine on the nVidia MX150 card.",

I updated the BIOS and Asus drivers. Still no problems. Installing the January cumulative update to Windows 1809, however, brought about frequent blue screens. The cause was the Nvidia MX150 driver starving for memory and crashing. I could fix the blue screens by disabling the Nvidia GPU but that loses a primary selling point of this laptop.",
                "Pros": "TL/DR; Useless laptop as shipped. Add a $30 4GB memory stick and the Asus S510UN has unbeatable performance for the price.",
                "Comments": "My 4-star rating is most definitely grading on a curve. Compare the Asus S510UN to high end laptops and it will end up last. That said, the S510UN strikes an excellent compromise between price and a laptop that can be used on the go without weighing down your bag. I deducted a star because of the memory issue. If you order the S510UN, make sure to add a 4GB memory stick to your Newegg cart.",

I had immediate remorse with the unboxing at how cheap this laptop appeared and felt in my hands.  I can't compare this to my Dell because it would be like comparing a Lexus to a Yugo. Can't wait to get a few dollars in my pocket for a replacement and give this ugly brick to my kids to destroy in 6-months.",

I asked if I was able to return the dock by itself for a new one, but they required that the entire product, (laptop, dock, charging cable) be returned in order to get a new product.

For the price (on sale under $3XX), it's a pretty good deal.  HD and RAM slot is easy to access. Empty RAM slot means you can max out the RAM at 12G instead of 8G.  Swapping out the slow HD with SSD really boosts the speed noticeably, much more so than boosting RAM.",

Most significant change from 8 to 8.1?  Yeah, the geniuses at MS finally decide to put an off button in the menu ... brilliant!",

Since it was out of warranty I figured it would cost more to fix than buying a replacement. I came across this refurbished laptop and the price was excellent. The touchscreen works well. I also like that it has a 10 key pad. The power cord is a nice change from my previous laptops as well. I like the form factor and not having a heavy brick. It plugs into a powerstrip without blocking the adjacent outlets.",
                "Comments": "Before buying I read the reviews and am not sure why some users thought it had bluetooth. Maybe the description changed by the time I bought it. I did see the complaint about Windows updates not working. When I first tried to manually install all the important Windows updates, it failed after running a very long time to download, apply, then back out the updates. I was disappointed but found what worked for me was to simply allow Windows to apply updates at shutdown. It did not apply all the updates, but each time I shutdown and allowed updates to be applied, it worked. I beleive all the important updates were applied in 3 reboots. Then I manually applied the optional updates. Lastly I updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. A little time consuming but I just let it churn away while I used my desktop.",
