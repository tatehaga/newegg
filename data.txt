                "Pros": "I bought 2 of these a year ago, several months apart, for friends, both computer novices.  One had an OLD desktop, prone to part failures.  The other is \"older\"; web surfing, e-mail, and skype sufficient.",
                "Comments": "Bought 2 used Lenovo ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3 USB 3.0 Type 4337 04W3587 w/Power Supply for the \"upgraded\" one plus one for my own use (it fits the T410, T420, and T430); works great (NOTE:  the T420 does not have USB3, only USB2; just upward compatible).  One advantage of the docking station is that it uses separate headphone/mike jacks.  The on-board headphone/mike jacks on these Thinkpads are a combined jack, so you'll need to buy an adapter if using those.",

                "Cons": "Its kind of heavy to carry, but within a week or so I got used to it in my bag. - It can be a bit noisy after having it on for a few hours. - Typing on the keyboard is a bit loud, but you only notice it when you're in a quiet place.",
                "Pros": "I bought this laptop well over a year ago and its still runs like a beauty. I'm a university student who already owns a high end gaming pc and I just needed something to access the internet, write word documents, and read pdf files. The laptop was brand new when I got it. Came with the windows key which I immediately upgraded to windows 10. Keyboard and track pad are really nice. Overall its a great budget laptop!",
                "Comments": "I would highly recommend switching to 8gb of ram, especially if you're a university student who has lots of tabs and pdf files opened at once. Also adding an SSD and configuring your setup for two drives is really nice. Tons of youtube videos and forums to look at if you're thinking of doing both.",
